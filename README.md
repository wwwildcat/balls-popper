## Balls Popper

A simple mini game on HTML, CSS and JS.

You'll have to move the needle left and right with arrow keys and pop balls of different sizes and colors. The balls fly up, but sometimes the wind blows them to the left or to the right. The less time you have, the more balls appear and the faster they move.
